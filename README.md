In this repository it is stored the code and outputs belonging to the project "Gene order Analysis in Protists".

**Distributions**: All the distributions performed throughout the study regarding associations of species identified in conserved gene clusters

**Scripts**: All the codes that were used for the project. Every code is annotated with a brief description

**Tables**: Csv tables exported from ReviGO. Mainly important since they are not part of the supplementary figures due to the large amount of tables involved.

**TreeMaps**^: Parallel representation of the csv tables from ReviGo in TreeMap format.
